# The Bibbin, Cheerfully Helpful Accomplice in Thieving

Thieves Guild legend tells of a desperately impoverished mage who struck a bargain of mutual aid with an otherworldly creature he called the Bibbin. The creature would aid in stealing, and in return ask only that someone, anyone, be punished for each crime the pair committed. And thus began a spree of thefts; each equally impossible but each with clues clearly leading to some new notable of the city.

Tales disagree as to how, but eventually this mage was caught and killed. The Bibbin, and all their loot remain hidden somewhere to this day.

Cost: Someone must be punished for each crime the Bibbin aids in. 
Loyalty: 1. Reduced for every crime that goes unpunished. If it reaches 0, the Bibbin may well find a way to turn you in. Loyalty may increase with effluent praise, but especially if an unusual number of people are punished for the crimes of the Bibbin. 

## Skills

As a hireling the Bibbin is of immense aid to thievery. 

### Bibbin Ladder

The Bibbin is long and strong with scales much like a shark and therefore makes a most excellent mobile ladder. 

### Whisper of Opening (+3)

The Bibbin can unlock any barrier with a touch of its tongue. 
  
### Plutomancy (+3)

The Bibbin knows much of treasure and can sense even the most cunningly concealed valuables. Add +3 to Spout Lore about wealth and treasures, and add +3 to Discern Realities as long as you ask "What here is of material value."
