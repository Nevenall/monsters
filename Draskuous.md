# Draskuous, An Ancient Psychic Mount

Fine and ancient are the Draskuous; creatures of stranger age. Rumor of them comes occasionally from environs so distant as to be thought as imaginary as the creatures themselves. Some still seek them, and some rarer few who find one, master the Draskuous and so ride one of these mighty tri-minded relics of forgotten wars.  

## Instinct

To reproduce; which they do by consuming the thoughtforms of a mind in the act of creation. 

## A Secret

It is said that a being strong enough of mind to endure the triple gaze of a Draskuous will earn it's respect and may thereafter bargain with it for mutual benefit.
