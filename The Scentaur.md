# The Scentaur

In the workshop of a slovenly alchemist a slug, one day, made its slimy way into a jar of desicated olfactory bulbs, and there it died. Little notice we might have taken of this commonplace event had said alchemist not conceived of a potion to enhance the olfactory apparatus of the king's poison taster.  

Alas, rather then the intended potion the world was given the Scentaur. A most bizarre and squishy amalgam of its antecedents.
