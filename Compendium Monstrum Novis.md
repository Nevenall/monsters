# Compendium Monstrum Novis

Since my young boy days it has been a peculiar habit of mine to seek out tales of macabre beasts and impossible creatures, but it was not until recently, when I ocassioned to hold in thrawl my dining companions with these stories, that it occured to me to assemble together in one volume descriptions of some few of my most fantastical monsters.

Now, praise the blessed muses, the task is done and I hope you shall smile upon the effort.
