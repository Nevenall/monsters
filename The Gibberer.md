# The Gibberer

There once was a young 'prentice mage
who sought power the envy of ages

He formulated his magical thesis
To summon a creature to spout out all secrets

but instead got this gibbering rager


The Gibberer, so it is reported, was birthed from a failed ritual to summon a being to speak secrets to its master. Instead, the Gibberer is a demented creature bent only on spreading the madness of the "secrets" which drools forth from its maw as a stinky yellow foam. The mierst fleck of this foam can spread the madness so the Gibberer always drags its razor claws through the foam before striking.
