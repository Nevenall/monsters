# The Gibberer, Walking Madness

There once was a young 'prentice mage
who sought power the envy of ages

He formulated his magical thesis
To summon a creature to spout out all secrets

but instead got this gibbering rager


The Gibberer, so it is reported, was birthed from a failed attempt to conjure a being to speak secrets to its master. Instead, the Gibberer is a demented creature bent only on sharing the madness of its "secrets" which drools forth from its maw as a stinking yellow foam. The merest fleck of this foam spreads madness, so the Gibberer is careful always to coat its claw before striking. 

## Instinct

Infect other beings with the Gibbering madness. 

## A Secret

It's believed the Gibberer is a magically summoned being, but it was, in fact, once human.

### Another Secret

The Gibberer will abandon all to eat any eggs it happens to see, even at it's own mortal peril.

## Listen to Secrets, Listen to Madness

On a 10+ you hear a secret.
On a 7-9 you hear a secret and are infected by madness.
On a miss you will slowly transform into a Gibberer yourself.
