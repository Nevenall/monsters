# The Gibberer

hideous laughter
drooling, (Elemental rabies?)
razor claws
man footprints



Madness
Crazy gibbering
Razor claws
Infectious foamy drool
Human like feet

The Gibberers motivation is to infect other beings with its madness. Therefore it commonly rakes its Claes though its drool foam  before it strikes to increase the risk of infection. Even better if it can sneak up and drool on your food. 
It's crafty, but not real sneaky. 

It's was created as a thing to speak secrets, but turns out there are things you don't. Want to know. 
If you listen too long to its mad gibbering, they might being to make sense. 

Or maybe you may hear secrets. 

Mmmm... Perhaps the visions one receives from the  creatures foamy infection can be of great use provided you survive. 

You do truly learn great secrets, but only for an instant before the madness takes you. 

The creature loves eggs and will always stop to eat them. Spends a good deal of time and trouble seeking eggs.
