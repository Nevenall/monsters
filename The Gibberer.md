# The Gibberer



There once was a young 'prentice mage
who sought power the envy of ages

He formulated his magical thesis
To summon a creature to spout out all secrets

but instead got this gibbering rager


The Gibberer, so it is reported, was birthed from a failed ritual to conjuring a being to speak secrets to its master. Instead, the Gibberer is a demented creature bent only on sharing the madness of its "secrets" which drools forth from its maw as a stinking yellow foam. The mearst fleck of this foam spreads madness, so the Gibberer is careful always to coat its claw before striking. 

## The Gibberer, Walking Madness

*Solitary, Intellegent*

HP 18
Armor 1 (Unnatural Hide)

Razor Claws (Close, d8, 2 Piercing) 

## Moves

- Cautiously stalk the weakest. 
- Steal many eggs.
- Leap with abandon into the midst of foes. 
- Leave the tracks of a barefooted human to deceive.
- Laugh hideously at the futilty of a foe's stuggles. 

## Listen to Secrets, Listen to Madness

When you are infected by the gibbering madness, roll + INT. 
On a 10+ you hear a secret.
On a 7-9 you hear a secret you wish you had not.
On a miss you hear a secret just before the madness takes you.


## Instinct

Spread its gibbering maddness. 

## Secret

It's believed the Gibberer is a magically summoned being, but it was, in fact, once human.
