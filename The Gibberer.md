LIke rabies meets werewolfism. <br> cures? <br> The horror of your hands turning into claws <br> thick matted hair starts growing all over your body <br> uncontrollable laughing etc. <br>

# The Gibberer

There once was a young 'prentice mage
who sought power the envy of ages

He formulated his magical thesis
To summon a creature to spout out all secrets

but instead got this gibbering rager


The Gibberer, so it is reported, was birthed from a failed ritual to conjuring a being to speak secrets to its master. Instead, the Gibberer is a demented creature bent only on sharing the madness of its "secrets" which drools forth from its maw as a stinking yellow foam. The mearst fleck of this foam spreads madness, so the Gibberer is careful always to coat its claw before striking.
