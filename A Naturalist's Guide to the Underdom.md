# A Naturalist's Guide to the Underdom

It was a great piece of luck for me when the chance to command a position on Lord Gravenmient's expidition presented itself to me. The purpose of this expidition was to explore some caverns recently discovered in Lord Gravenmient's domain. 


## Morlocks & Knafs

We travelled for some days into the caverns and discovered these evil creatures who keep small viscious beasts to aid defense of their homes and on their occasional raids into the overland during the most moonless of nights. 

### Morlock and Light

they are most sensitive to any light, but someof them also seem to possess strange inhuman magics that can extinguish lights. Or summon vast columns of pure darkness. 


## Field Fungus

Fleeing from the Morlocks towards the faint glimmer of light we hoped was real, we came upon a vast gallery of glowing and richly aromatic fungi. 

Deeper now, in the caverns, we argued much about what to do and decided to proceed deeper in hopes of finding other avenues of escape without encountering morlocks again. 



## Drankers

These magestic creatures are great purifiers of water, subsisings as they do on whatever bits of organic materials they can find lurking in the waters where they make their home. At first approch they can eisily be mistakeing for unusual cavern formations, but be wary for they hunt with their trunks beneith the water and can sneak up upon the unwary such as two of our companions. 

### Dranker Pearls

Gems of rare quality are produced by the drankers. They tend to pile up around the largest of the drankers.

### The Crystal Window

Each of the drankers processes their food in a chamber where one might naturally place their eyes. There is a crystal window to the chamber so that it is possible to watch one's companions being dizzoloved by the drankers virualant acids. It is also possible, we discovered, to recover lost equipment by breaking open this crystal window and allowing the acids to spill out, as I was forced to do to recover some rather expensive pieces of my equipment Harly and Barley happened to be portering for me.
